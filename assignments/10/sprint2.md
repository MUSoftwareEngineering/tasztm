### GitBash Setup

Use [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to run the git commands necessary to clone the Augur repo. Of course this can also be done with any Windows git tool like GitHub Desktop.

### Make Setup

There's two ways to run the Augur installation. This can be done via NMAKE, the Windows equivalent to make, or through a program like GnuMake. We'll go over how to do both of these. NMAKE comes with Visual Studio which is convenient.
