# Sprint 1 - Trey Shaw

This will be primarily backend work, but the full stack will likely be used.

(Relating info can be found in issue #403)

### General Design Goals
- build and run Augur on a Windows environment
- create documentation on how to do this in a well defined, stable way
- include visual aids such as screenshots
- test and successfully run Augur on Windows 10 devices, ideally older versions of Windows as well
