#Trey Shaw's Thoughts on Ethics in Software Engineering
1. Know your abilities. When describing your ability, avoid embelishing to make yourself seem more competent. (Also only discuss your abilities when it's relevant).
2. If your users' data will be going beyond the software they're using, make it clear to them what data of theirs will be out there. If you want to sell data, every user should have a reasonable chance to be aware that it will be used elsewhere.
3. If a tool can help the community, it should be accessable to as many as possible.
4. Software development is about creation, not necessarily making money (both is great though).
5. Respect the creations of others.
